# odin-landing-page
landing page project from The Odin Project

Through the project I will learn how to create a website layout from scratch. Aswell as the real process of working through a larger project (breaking it into parts, working on it over several days)

## post-project reflection
I believe I completed it in only 2 days? But it took many work sessions which really pushed my motivation especially when things were'nt working. 
The main thing, mentally, was having the feeling of doing something wrong/ineffeciently so I tried using the most elegant solution first instead of the simplest one. Even weird things like using exact units (which is completely normal) I felt uncomfortable about at first.
I'll probably still watch that Traversy Media Flexbox vid.
