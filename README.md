# odin-landing-page
landing page project from The Odin Project

Through the project I will learn how to create a website layout from scratch. Aswell as the real process of working through a larger project (breaking it into parts, working on it over several days)

## post-project reflection

this is the change

describe the problem and how you solved it 

example 
Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo

Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information

what and why
added alt text for accesability
not 
how
added alt='stuff' or used justify-content: center
